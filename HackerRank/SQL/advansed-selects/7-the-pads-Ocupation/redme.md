# üìù SQL Query Task: Occupations

## Overview

This task involves generating two result sets from the `OCCUPATIONS` table:

1. **Alphabetically Ordered List of Names with Occupation Initials**:  
   Generate a list of all names in the `OCCUPATIONS` table, ordered alphabetically, followed by the first letter of each profession enclosed in parentheses.  
   Example: `AnActorName(A)`, `ADoctorName(D)`, `AProfessorName(P)`, `ASingerName(S)`.

2. **Count of Each Occupation**:  
   Query the number of occurrences of each occupation in `OCCUPATIONS`. Sort the results in ascending order by occupation and format them as follows:  
   Example: `There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.`

SELECT 
    CONCAT('There are a total of ', COUNT(*), ' ', LOWER(Occupation), 's.') AS OccupationCount
FROM

GROUP BY 
    Occupation
ORDER BY 
    COUNT(*) ASC, Occupation ASC;
```
